     * change in the JVM as well as the Java library.
     *
     * Although there is no scheduled release for Loom yet, we can access the recent
     * prototypes on Project Loom's wiki.
     *
     * Before we discuss the various concepts of Loom, let's discuss the current concurrency
     * model in Java.
